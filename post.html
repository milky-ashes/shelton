						<p>We just received a photo from a customer in Colorado.  This photo was delivered in an email titled “real world” – not many words beyond that.</p>
						<p>We reached out to him to let him know we supported the image and his work on the jeans.  He replied back with two words, “Garage tested”.</p>
						<p>We know a little about this customer, we’ve picked up on bits and pieces.  We know he started out as a youngster racing BMX, then he moved to motor-cross, and then he went into advertising.</p>
						<p>We believe he was pretty successful at all three; successful enough that he can spend as much time in his garage as he wants.</p>
						<p>Now that’s inspiring: work hard and smart and eventually gain your freedom.  For the most of us that aren’t there yet, let’s not be hard on ourselves, it takes time and a lot of work.</p>
						<p>We shipped him a pair of selvedge dark jeans in February 2012.  It was his first pair of Todd Shelton jeans.</p>

						</figure>
						<p>This is the first pair he received (above image).  We have since shipped him two more pair.</p>
						<p>If we were to compare wear patterns on jeans, we believe what you see in this image is second to none – because it’s real!  I don’t think he was calculated with how often he washed these jeans.  I don’t think he was concerned about preserving sharp fades.</p>
						<p>He simply worked them, hard.</p>
						<p>We share this image to inspire you.  These jeans weren’t designed to be precious, they were designed to be worn, as hard as you want to wear them.</p>
						<p>The ultimate compliment for us?  Wear your jeans hard, then, send us an image.</p>
