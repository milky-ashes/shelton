							<h4>Making the product you design is hard.</h4>
							<p>Email is the easiest way to contact us and the best way to ensure you receive the most thorough answer. Please allow up to one business day for a reply. You have to lead a production team.  You have to build a knowledge base.  Maintain a factory full of machines.  It’s hard.</p>
							<p>All of it’s hard. </p>
							<p>Most every brand I know doesn’t want to make their own product.  Because it’s hard. </p>
							<p>A brand can design clothing and then ask a factory to make it.  That’s easy. But can they ever fully understand their art?  We’ve been on both sides and we don’t think so.</p>
