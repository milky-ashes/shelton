									"Thank you so much! The jeans, as they were with the last pair, are the best jeans I own by a long shot. Same perfect fit, same top quality. Again thank you so much! I look forward to buying more from you in the coming months."

									Thank you for your email. I love the interest you're taking in soliciting my feedback; certainly rare these days, if nonexistent. First, I am VERY HAPPY! The moment I took your jeans out of the box, I knew I had something special in my hands. The feel and weight of the denim, the stitching, the piping inside the pockets, the extra material next to the zipper. It's just a beautifully manufactured product! The jeans fit great. The very thorough sizing directions on the website were invaluable, and proved accurate. I have to tell you I found Todd Shelton because I was looking from American made jeans. The company's philosophy fits with mine, and the website is excellent, the way it explains the differences in materials, sizing, the blog, etc. I LOVE THEM AND WILL NEVER RETURN THEM! Thanks so much, and I will be recommending Todd Shelton to everyone I meet.
